# jQuery.texthinge()

[Demo](http://beatak.github.com/jquery-texthinge/)

This jQuery plugin allows you to wrap a text line by the width of the element in a brute force manner.  Yes, you read it right.  Brute force.  But with using CSS3 `text-overlow` property (according to *[When can I use](http://caniuse.com/#search=text-overflow)*, it has 92.61% coverage as of Aug 2012), you may be able to use it in an interesting way.  See this [demo](http://beatak.github.com/jquery-texthinge/) on github pages for the best usecase.

## Known issue

It doesn't seem to work on IE7.  There must be a way to make it work on IE7, but I don't dig.  For now.
